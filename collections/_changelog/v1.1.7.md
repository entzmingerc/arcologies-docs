- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">NEW</span> Add kudzu structure. You'll climb the wrist-thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Towers. And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn, laying stripes of venison on the empty car pool lane of some abandoned superhighways.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">NEW</span> Add kudzu management features in parameters menu. `KUDZU METABOLISM`, `KUDZU RESILIENCE` and `KUDZU CRUMBLE` set the defaults for newly created kudzu (children kudzu inherit metabolism and resilience from their parents.) `KUDZU AGGRESSION` sets how many growths happen each beat. `KUDZU CROPDUST POTENCY` sets how much the kudzu crumbe with each `> CROPDUST`.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">CHANGE</span> Re-organize parameter menu.
