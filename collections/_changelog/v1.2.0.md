_"arctangents & archangels"_
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">NEW</span> monome arc support. This allows you to map your arc to various controls: norns encoders 1-3, "browse cells", change crypt directory, global transpose, BPM, and "danger zone" clock.sync(x). One interesting convention of note: encoders that "sparkle" will musically alter your arcology. Encoders that do not are "safe" and are reserved for tasks such as menu navigation. Map your arc encoders and set orientation via the norns parameters menu.
