version: v1.1.6

- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">NEW</span> Set `NOTE COUNT` for structures with multiple notes.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">NEW</span> Global transpose for MIDI and SuperCollider structures.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">CHANGE</span> Load and save routines have been rationalized. I was was maintaining separate logic for minor patch versions which was unsustainable. `v1.0.3` and prior arcologies should be loaded with a ~95% accuracy. The great metabolism refactor of `v1.0.4` still means you have to retune your metabolisms.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">DEV</span> Move structures out of `config.lua` and into their own file.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">DEV</span> Cleanup `fn.cleanup()`.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">DEV</span> Add `channel` to `m:all_off()`.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">DEV</span> Organize `functions.lua`.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">DEV</span> Structures without glyphs will render the default cell glyph instead.
