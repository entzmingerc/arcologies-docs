- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">CHANGE</span> Metabolism now defaults to `13`. See the metabolism table in the docs for more information and rationale.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">CHANGE</span> Metabolism behavior on hives and raves is inverted. `1` is now _slow_, while `16` is now _fast_. 
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary">FIX</span> Steps on the step sequencer for hives and raves accurately reflect when signals will fire.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">CHANGE</span> If the metabolism of a dome or a maze is less than the global length, then fill in the length by looping the pattern. This makes for much more musical results than what the "pure mathematics" would give us.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">CHANGE</span> Mazes erase from the _beginning_ of the register instead of the end. This ensures the trains collide head-on instead of riding parallel into deadzones. Note a moving register can allow for notes to slip "under" the playhead. This is intentional.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">CHANGE</span> Structure is now at the _bottom_ of the designer menu, instead of docs. This lets you crank e2 and know you'll always land on the structure attribute - much better than landing on docs.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">CHANGE</span> Tightened up the analysis page.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">CHANGE</span> Seeding now happens in the parameters menu.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">NEW</span> Enable and disable structures for seeding on the parameters menu.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">NEW</span> Loaded arcology name displays on home page.
