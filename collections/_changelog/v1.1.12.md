- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">NEW</span> Fracture structure... a hypothetical traveller from another universe — presumably an older, more broken one — entering our own.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">CHANGE</span> Vales can now send MIDI.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">CHANGE</span> Remove superfluous `midi:disconnect()` calls to help with DIY gear.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary">FIX</span> Cell designer menu jumping bug of doom has been isolated and fixed. It was the kudzu's fault.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary">FIX</span> Cropdusting was partially failing - kudzu was actually growing in the ornithopters targeting systems.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary">FIX</span> Cells only mutate into structures when the popup goes away. Previously they would mutate while selecting leading to ports being toggled (in the case of raves and windfarms, for example) or immortal kudzu spawning.
- <span class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary">DEV</span> Stubby glyphs display properly.
