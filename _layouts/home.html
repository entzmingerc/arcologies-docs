        <p>When changing values with e3, some items will use a pop-up menu. Unless otherwise specified on the screen, a 0.4 second threshold of inactivity (i.e. less than half a second after you stop turning e3) will result in returning to the previous menu. Note that the value selection is instantaneous - not 0.4 seconds - and some pop-up menus have an ABORT option available at the "bottom" of the values (i.e. spin e3 counter-clockwise until you see ABORT).</p>

    <h2 id="cells">Cells</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Cells are the building blocks of <strong>arcologies</strong>. Each key of grid represents a cell. Each cell has a structure, but these structures can be changed. Structures define qualities, behaviors, and attributes of a cell.</p>
    <p>Cells also have four ports, each of which can either be open or closed. Ports direct the flow of signals.</p>

    <h2 id="signals">Signals</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon">photons</a>, signals are the elementary particle of <strong>arcologies</strong>. All signals are created equal: they move at the same speed, have the same attributes, and interact with the world around them exactly as each other signal would. Signals really only have one meaningful attribute: a <em>heading</em>.</p>
    <p>Signals move in straight lines. Signal headings are simply the cardinal directions of north, east, south, and west.</p>
    <p>Signals allow cells to ineract at a distance. Some cells emit signals. Other cells destory signals. Yet others multiply, divide, and change the direction of signals.</p>
    <p>If two (or more) would occupy the same coordinate at the same time, they will all be destroyed.</p>
    <p>Signals are destroyed when they leave the boundaries of the grid.</p>

        <h3 id="cells">&mdash; Leylines</h3>
          <p>Leylines help you visualize the signal flow of your arcology. Opening a port will draw a leyline to a terminus (either a cell or the edge of the grid.) Leylines are purely decorative and have no functional impact on your arcology.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>For monome <a href="https://monome.org/docs/norns">norns</a> and <a href="https://monome.org/docs/grid">grid</a>, <strong>arcologies</strong> is a 21st century instrument for musical composition and discovery.</p>
    <p>The core design objective for this software is clarity. Each key and encoder on norns have a dedicated function. All the keys on the grid share the same behavior. The menus are built to be fast, intuitive, cohesive, and consistent. With a foundation that is (hopefully) quick to master, the arcologist's focus can shift to sculpting emergent and complex compositions.</p>
    <p>The design of <strong>arcologies</strong> heavily inspired by the two-dimensionality of <a href="https://100r.co/site/orca.html">Orca</a>, the polymorphism of <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">ornament & crime</a>, and the immediacy of <a href="https://monome.org/docs/meadowphysics/">meadowphysics</a>. Other curios played a part, too: <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">tower defense</a> genre, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">SimCity</a>, and the <a href="http://generativemusic.com/">Eno / Chilvers</a> suite of generative applications, carbon-based life, water, the anthropocene, supply chains, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mushroom_at_the_End_of_the_World">The Mushroom at the End of the World</a>, <a href="https://dark-mountain.net/">The Dark Mountain Project</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/eco-futurism-corp">Eco Futurism Corp</a>, <a href="https://danielseankelly.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/in-the-days-of-the-seasteaders-or-how-the-extropian-detritivores-broke-capitalism/">"seasteading"</a>, the gedankenexperiment-prompt: "sound artist's work in a William Gibson novel?", <a href="https://journal.highlandsolutions.com/cellular-automata-in-javascript-c0336af3e1f3">Conway's Game of Life</a>, Garfield Park Conservatory, the Epcot Center, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a>, and the need to challenge myself and create something beautiful during this fucking pandemic.
