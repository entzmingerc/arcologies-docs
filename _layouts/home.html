    <h2 id="cells">Cells</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Cells are the building blocks of <strong>arcologies</strong>. Cells have four key components:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#ports">Ports</a></li>
      <li><a href="#structures">Structure</a></li>
      <li><a href="#notes">Notes</a></li>
      <li><a href="#metabolism">Metabolism</a></li>

  <div class="col mb-5">
    <h3 id="ports">Ports</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Ports direct the flow of signals. Each cell has four ports: north, east, south, west. Open ports allow signals in. Closed ports stop signals. Select a cell, then press adjacent keys to toggle ports on and off.</p>
    <p>Hives emit signals from <em>all open</em> ports at a rate as defined by their metabolism. The default metabolism is 4. This means every fourth generation (or "beat") signals will be emitted.</p>
    <p>Gates and shrines route incoming signals to <em>every other</em> open port. So if a gate or shrine only has one port open, any signal that enters will be destroyed. If a gate or shrine has two ports open, the signal will emerge from the other port. If a gate or shrine has three ports open, the signal will be split in two and emerge from the other two ports. Finally, if all four ports are open, the signal will emerge from all three other ports.</p>

    <h3 id="structures">Structures</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Each active cell has one structure. Structure is configured via in the quick menu. Newly activated cells default to whatever global structure is set. Hive is the default.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>Shrines play their note when a signal collides with them. <strong>arcologies</strong> supports the chromatic scale of C1 - F#5. Like metabolism, each cell has a note configured, though only shrines use notes.</p>

    <p>Metabolism is the rate at which hives birth signals.</p>

    <h2 id="signals">Signals</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Signals are born from hives, routed and split by both gates and shrines, and play notes at shrines.</p>
    <p>Signals have a position (<code>x</code> & <code>y</code>) and a direction (<code>n</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>s</code>, or <code>w</code>).
    <p>If a signal collides into a closed port, the signal disappears into silence (the poor little signal just smashed into a wall.) The same is true if it wanders off the grid. The same is true if they collide with a hive. If a leyline disappears from beneath a signal, the signal will continue along. Perhaps you can help it will find its way again?</p>
    <p>If two (or more) signals land at the same place at the same time -- either in the grid or at a cell -- both will be destroyed. However, signals may "pass" through each other so long as they wouldn't land at the same cell on the same beat.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>Create leylines by opening ports. These help you visualize the signal flow of your arcology. Leylines can cross over each other without consequence.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>For monome <a href="https://monome.org/docs/norns">norns</a> and <a href="https://monome.org/docs/grid">grid</a>, <strong>arcologies</strong> is a 21st century instrument for musical composition and discovery.</p>
    <p>The core design objectives for this project are consistency and clarity. Each key and encoder is dedicated to a single function. All the keys on the grid share the same behavior. All the keys and encoders on norns do the same thing in all contexts. The menus are fast, intuitive (I hope), and above all <em>consistent</em>. With a foundation that is (hopefully) simple to learn, the arcologist's focus can shift to sculpting emergent and complex compositions.</p>
    <p>The design of <strong>arcologies</strong> heavily inspired by the two-dimensionality of <a href="https://100r.co/site/orca.html">Orca</a>, the polymorphism of <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">ornament & crime</a>, and the immediacy of <a href="https://monome.org/docs/meadowphysics/">meadowphysics</a>. Other curios played a part, too: <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">tower defense</a> genre, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">SimCity</a>, and the <a href="http://generativemusic.com/">Eno / Chilvers</a> suite of generative applications, carbon-based life, water, the anthropocene, supply chains, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mushroom_at_the_End_of_the_World">The Mushroom at the End of the World</a>, <a href="https://dark-mountain.net/">The Dark Mountain Project</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/eco-futurism-corp">Eco Futurism Corp</a>, <a href="https://danielseankelly.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/in-the-days-of-the-seasteaders-or-how-the-extropian-detritivores-broke-capitalism/">"seasteading"</a>, the gedankenexperiment-prompt: "sound artist's work in a William Gibson novel?", <a href="https://journal.highlandsolutions.com/cellular-automata-in-javascript-c0336af3e1f3">Conway's Game of Life</a>, Garfield Park Conservatory, the Epcot Center, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a>, and the need to challenge myself and create something beautiful during this fucking pandemic.
